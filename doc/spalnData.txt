DESCRIPTION of spaln.data
--------
`ref' directory contains the information about exon-intron structures 
of 491 human and 487 mouse genes. This information was slightly modified
from that of the original annotation presented in Projector web site:
	http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/analysis/projector
as described in the text.

Each `MmIn' directory contains test sequences with artificial noises.
Only one of six test series is presented.

The genomic sequences are included in P491Data.

DESCRIPTION of G178Data, P491Data, C756Data
--------
In each dataset, `genef' directory contains genomic fragment sequences 
in FASTA format, `pas' and `sws' directories contain reference protein 
sequences in FASTA format, `ref' directory contains the exon-intron 
structural information of the corresponding genomic fragments, and 
`refg' directory contains the coordinate of exon boundaries in the 
whole genomic sequence of human (Build 36.1), mouse (Build 37.1) and 
chicken (Build 2.1). The format of exon boundaries is similar to that 
of GenBank but simplified.
